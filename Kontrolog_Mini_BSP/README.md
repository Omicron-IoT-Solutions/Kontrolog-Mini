version 1.0 September 2024

In this library you will be able to perform deeper control over the Kontrolog Mini hardware.

The Kontrolog Mini is a versatile, programmable IoT controller designed to facilitate real-time remote monitoring and control of processes in multiple applications. Its technology is based on the powerful ESP32, this device is ideal for any application. ESP32, this device is ideal for any kind of IoT project, allowing the integration of wireless communication technologies such as LoRaWAN, Sigfox, WiFi and Bluetooth.

In this library you will be able to configure at your convenience the ports available for the execution of your ideas, from execution of your ideas, from reading sensors, both analog and digital, activation of digital outputs such as relays, and a wide range of relay type digital outputs, and a wide range of communication systems available thanks to the integration of modules such as the LSM11A, CH340C and MAX485.

Important!
For your projects to work successfully, you must include the following libraries in the PlatformIO initialization file platformio.ini

We have available for you a series of documents and tutorials that you can access directly from 
[our GitHub repository](https://github.com/Omicron-IoT-Solutions/Kontrolog-Mini).

As a quick start, you can access the following tutorials in which we introduce you to the Kontrolog 
Mini and its possible applications; we explain you how the hardware is made up and the basic drawings and
and what you should consider; and we show you through an example of reading an NTC 10k temperature sensor:

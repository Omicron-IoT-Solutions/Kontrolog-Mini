In this library you will be able to perform deeper control over the Kontrolog Mini hardware.

The Kontrolog Mini is a versatile, programmable IoT controller designed to facilitate real-time remote monitoring and control of processes in multiple applications. 
Its technology is based on the powerful ESP32, this device is ideal for any application. 
ESP32, this device is ideal for any kind of IoT project, allowing the integration of wireless 
wireless communication technologies such as LoRaWAN, Sigfox, WiFi and Bluetooth.

In this library you will be able to configure at your convenience the ports available for the execution of your ideas, from 
execution of your ideas, from reading sensors, both analog and digital, activation of digital outputs such as relays, and a wide range of relay type digital outputs, and a wide range of communication systems available thanks to the integration of modules such as the LSM11A, CH340C and MAX485.
